## A beginning.

When you search for flights or hotels on Google, Kayak or other online travel sites, they often indicate whether your options are the best deals and whether prices are expected to go up or not. Shouldnâ€™t we have the same capability for rents?

My wife and I just moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area and have looked for a 2bd house or apartnment in Millbrae, Burlingame, and San Mateo. The price range for a 2bd house or apartment in these cities is from $2.7k to $4.0k per month. We have spent more than 30 hours respectively searching for available options without knowing whether the houses or apartments we have found were priced appropriately. As 90,000 people moved to the San Francisco Bay area between July 2014 and July 2015, we could have wasted 2.7M hours collectively. In this context, the Bay Area Rent Price Predictor will prevent incoming residents in San Francisco Bay Area from wasting time by showing them whether a rent price was likely to go up or down.

## A middle.
Based on the historical data of house and apartment sales and rents in the San Francisco Bay Area, the model will identify upward or downward trends in terms of home prices and rents and suggest the dates when newcomers are encouraged to move to the San Francisco Bay Area.

## An end.

When people considering a move from different cities look for a place to rent in the San Francisco Bay Area, they are able to make a quick and right decision (pass/visit/apply) since the rent price predictor can show whether a rent price is within an appropriate range and how likely the price is to go up or down in the foreseeable future. As a result, potential newcomes will save more than 2.7M hours and still find places at the right prices in the San Francisco Bay Area.
